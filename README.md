# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview 
In this project, we used the pandas library in python as well as the matplotlib package to analyze the total ride-share fares by day for three city types: rural, suburban, and urban.  Our resource data was individual ride-shares by date, time, city, cost, and city type.

## Results
All figures shown here can be found in the "Analysis" folder of this repository.<br />
During the roughly 4 months that this study looked at, urban areas had on average, 7 more rides per day than suburban areas, and 18 more rides per day than rural areas.  Shown below is a box and whiskers plot of the number of daily rides for each city type.<br />

However, while urban areas had more rides per day than suburban or rural (which is to be expected), the average fare was highest for rural areas (see figure below).  This may not be surprising, since fares would likely take into account distance and rural areas tend to be much more sparsely populated.

Overall, though, urban areas accounted for almost 63 percent of the total fares for the over 4 month period in this analysis (see pie chart below)<br />

The total weekly fares taken in by city types is shown below.  Given the results above, it is not surprising that the urban areas took in much more in fares each week.
